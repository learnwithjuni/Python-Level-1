# This code is needed at the beginning of every project:

import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()

# This is how I write a loop that draws a square:

for i in range(4):
  t.forward(50)
  t.right(90)

# Explain how the computer knows how many times to repeat the loop:
# 

# Here I added code that will move the turtle to a new spot:

t.penup()
t.goto(100,100)
t.pendown()

# This is how I write a loop that draws a circle:

for i in range(36):
  t.forward(3)
  t.right(10)


# Explain how the above code works:
# 
# Explain how I could draw  a half circle:
# 

# Here I added code that will move the turtle to a new spot:

t.penup()
t.goto(-100,-100)
t.pendown()

# This is how I write a loop that draws a rectangle:

for i in range(2):
  t.forward(100)
  t.right(90)
  t.forward(30)
  t.right(90)
