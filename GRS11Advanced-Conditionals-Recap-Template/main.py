# Use a commonplace example to explain how if and else work together?
#


# Make a random number between 1 and 10. If the number is less than or equal to 5, make a turtle do a leftword spin. Otherwise, make a turtle do a rightword spin.


# Explain how you use elif.
#


# What will be checked first, the if condition or the elif condition?
#


# Edit your code so that if the random number is less than or equal to 7 and greater than 5 that the turtle draws a circle.


# Change your code so that your random number is between 1 and 20. Next, add 2 more elifs which draw a circle and rectangle if other possible numbers occur.
