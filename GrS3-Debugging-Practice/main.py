# Your friend, Kant D. Bugg, is having some problems trying to run his Python with Turtle program. Help Kant find the bugs in his code and fix them!

# Each time you run the code, read the error messages in the console. Each message will tell you what line to look for a bug, and even give you a hint about what the bug is.

# After you find and fix the bug, run the code again. Read the new error message and find the next bug, until the program runs fully!

# If you can't remember how to fix a certain line of code, look at one of your past projects for an example.
