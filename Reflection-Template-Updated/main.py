First, take some time to reflect and answer the following questions. Add your answer in the space below each question.

There are no right or wrong answers to these questions, just answer them with how you are really feeling and you will do great :)

It's ok if some of these questions are hard to answer. You can talk them out with your instructor and take some time to brainstorm.

Now, take your answers and compile them into one paragraph reflecting on what you've learned about Python so far. This should involve using the answers you wrote above, but feel free to change the order of the questions, or add anything else that comes to mind when you are thinking back on the work you've done:
    ADD YOUR SUMMARY HERE



Once your paragraph is done, copy and paste it into the #sharing-corner channel of the Python Club! Watch the following video if you need help remembering how to do that:
