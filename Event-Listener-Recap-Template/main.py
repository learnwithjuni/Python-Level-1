# What else do we need to create to make an event listener:


# Explain what an event listener is:
#

# List out the three parts of an event listener:
# 

# Write a function that moves the turtle to a random location


# Write a function that draws something, such as a flower or an octogon


# Make it so the turtle moves to a random place when you press the 'r' key, and so it draws your object when you press the 'd' key


# Add the last command you need for event listeners?
