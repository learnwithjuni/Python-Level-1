# If the variable x starts at 3 and then we do x += 5, what is the value of x now?


# Write a while loop which runs makes a turtle go forward by 1px 10 times.

counter = 0
while counter < 10:
  t.forward(1)
  counter += 1

# Write the same loop using a for loop.

for i in range(10):
  t.forward(1)

# Make two variables, one called lineLength and the other one called degrees. Set lineLength to 10 and degrees to 5. Use a while loop to have the turtle move forward by lineLength and then turn by degrees 10 times, then increment lineLength by 5 and degrees by 1 each time.

lineLength = 10
degrees = 5

counter = 0
while counter < 10:
  t.forward(lineLength)
  t.right(degrees)
  lineLength += 10
  degrees += 5
  counter += 1

# Explain how the above code works:
# 
# Explain how we you can figure out what the value of lineLength and degrees will be by the end of the loop.
