# Explain what a list is:
#

# Make an empty list named turtles

turtles = []

# Add 3 turtles to turtles

for i in range(3):
  t = turtle.Turtle()
  turtles.append(t)

# Loop through turtles and have each turtle move 50 pixels forward

for turt in turtles:
  turt.forward(50)

# Edit your loop so that the turtles turn a random amount of degrees before going forward

for turt in turtles:
  turt.right(random.randint(1,360))
  turt.forward(50)
