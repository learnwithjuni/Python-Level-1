# If the variable x starts at 3 and then we do x += 5, what is the value of x now?


# Write a while loop which runs makes a turtle go forward by 1px 10 times.


# Write the same loop using a for loop.


# Make two variables, one called lineLength and the other one called degrees. Set lineLength to 10 and degrees to 5. Use a while loop to have the turtle move forward by lineLength and then turn by degrees 10 times, then increment lineLength by 5 and degrees by 1 each time.


# Explain how the above code works:
# 
# Explain how we you can figure out what the value of lineLength and degrees will be by the end of the loop.
